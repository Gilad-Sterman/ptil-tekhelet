                            The temple - with its veils, wall coverings and tools, and the clothes of the priests who served in the service of God - was the biggest 'customer' of the Tekhelet market.

                            The city of Tyre was known as the center of the Murex dye industry since the days of King Solomon.
                            <br />
                            King Hiram of Tyre sent craftsmen to help build the temple, among them were also experts in Tekhelet.
                            <br />
                            During the period of the Mishna and the Talmud, Tyre was a trading center, and its most important commodity was snail-dyed fabrics.
                            <br />
                            This can be seen on the coin depicting the founding myth of Tyre - Hercules' dog discovering the Murex.
                            <br />
                            Trade knows no borders, and businessmen often traveled from Israel to Tyre, and learned firsthand about the dye industry there.
                            <br />
                            The Midrash even tells about Rabbi Haya and Rabbi Shimon (Rabbi's son) who went to Tyre to trade textiles.

                            Abaye, who lived in Babylon far from the Tekhelet snails in the Mediterranean Sea, questioned Rabbi Shmuel bar Yehuda upon his arrival from Israel:
                            <br />
                            "Tekhelet, how do you dye it?"
                            <br />
                            The answer was somewhat laconic - you take snail extract, add chemicals, heat it... that in relation to dyeing.
                            <br />
                            But there were additional halachic considerations, Rabbi Shmuel said,
                            <br />
                            In other words, one must be very careful not to spoil the dye vat by doing actions that are not directly related to the dyeing Mitzvah.
                            <br />
                            From this we learn the importance of the proper intention at each stage of dyeing - for the sake of the Mitzvah of Tzitzit.

                            The Gmara tells of two Jews from Israel who brought Tekhelet to Raba, a great Amorite in Babylon,
                            <br />
                            But they were caught on their way by an "eagle".
                            <br />
                            The story had a happy ending, "thanks to mercy and thanks to them they got out safely".
                            <br />
                            Despite the decrees of the Romans (whose symbol was an eagle) that prohibited the use of Tekhelet and Argaman,
                            <br />
                            Jews still risked their lives to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tzitzit in its entirety with the Tekhelet string.
                            <br />
                            They were also willing to smuggle Tekhelet from Israel to their brothers in Babylon despite the dangers involved.

                            The Talmud tells about the tests carried out by Rav Achai to determine if blue threads are authentic Tekhelet or Kala Ilan - a fake dye of plant origin.
                            <br />
                            This Gmara teaches us some important things:
                            <br />
                            â€¢ The appearance of Kala Ilan (indigo) is exactly the same as that of Tekhelet.

                            â€¢ There are only two options to paint in the Tekhelet color - with Tekhelet from the snail or with Kala Ilan, and there is no third option.
                            <br />
                            â€¢ And most importantly, the Tekhelet was available until the days of Rav Achai, but this is the last documentation of its use.
